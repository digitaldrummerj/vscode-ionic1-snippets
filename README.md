## Change Log

1.0

* Changed: snippet prefix from ionic to i1_
* Fixed: issue with snippets that had semi-colon having intellsense for snippet name disappearing when you typed the semi-colon
* Changed: i1_modal to have 2 versions
	* i1_modal_script uses the javascript syntax for embedding the template inside a script tag within the html
	* i1_modal_html created the html for ion-modal-view with a title and content area.  meant for use when you are using a seperate template file for the modal.
